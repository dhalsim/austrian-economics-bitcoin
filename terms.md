- **Debates/Contrasts**: Short-run non-neutrality vs. long-run neutrality; measurement and identification.

### Economic Calculation (Calculation Problem/Critique)

### Price Signals and Profit/Loss
- **Definition**: Prices convey knowledge and incentives; profits and losses guide resource reallocation.
- **Contributors**: Hayek; Mises; Kirzner.
- **Evolution**: Central to market-process theory and institutional analysis.
- **Debates/Contrasts**: Administered prices/regulation vs. decentralized pricing; externalities and knowledge problems in policy.

### Relative Prices
- **Definition**: The price of one good in terms of another (or via money as a common numeraire). In Austrian terms, relative prices emerge from subjective marginal valuations interacting with objective constraints (stocks, technology) and institutional context, guiding resource allocation and calculation.
- **Contributors**: Menger (causal-realist price formation); Böhm-Bawerk (intertemporal/interest); Mises (monetary calculation, non-neutral money); Hayek (prices as knowledge); Cantillon (injection effects on relative prices). Mainstream roots in Walras/Marshall too.
- **Evolution**: From classical cost-of-production to marginalist valuation; Austrian emphasis on process, entrepreneurship, and monetary non-neutrality (Cantillon effects) shaping relative, not uniform, price changes.
- **Debates/Contrasts**: Focus on relative prices vs. aggregate price levels; central planning’s inability to replicate relative price signals; index targeting/average inflation vs. sectoral relative-price distortions; static equilibrium vs. dynamic discovery.
- **Notes (water–diamond example)**: Prices reflect marginal utility of the next unit, not “total utility.” Where water is abundant at the margin, its marginal utility (and thus price) can be low despite high total usefulness. Under scarcity (drought), water’s marginal utility and price spike. Marketing/branding and certification (e.g., diamonds) shift subjective valuations and perceived qualities, altering demand and hence relative prices.
 - **Importance in AET**: Relative prices are the core signals that coordinate plans. They enable monetary calculation, guide entrepreneurial discovery, allocate capital across the multi‑stage structure of production, and transmit monetary disturbances. ABCT centers on distortions in relative prices (not just the overall price level), so policies that target aggregates while ignoring relative price signals risk misallocation and malinvestment.
 - **Intertemporal comparisons (real vs. nominal)**: Relative price is a same-time ratio across goods. To compare a good’s price across time, deflate by a broad index (e.g., CPI) or compare to other benchmarks (wages/time price, other goods). Austrians caution that CPI averages can mask sector-specific relative-price shifts driven by monetary non-neutrality (Cantillon effects), so use multiple benchmarks.
