## Austrian Economics: A Chronological Overview

### Precursors and Intellectual Roots (1500s–1800s)

- **School of Salamanca (16th–17th c.)**: Francisco de Vitoria, Domingo de Soto, Luis de Molina, Juan de Mariana. Early insights on subjective value, just price as market price, money, inflation, and property rights.
- **Richard Cantillon (c. 1680–1734)**: Essay on the Nature of Trade in General (written c. 1730s; published 1755). Entrepreneur as uncertainty bearer, spatial/money circulation analysis, relative prices.
- **Anne Robert Jacques Turgot (1727–1781)**: Reflections on the Formation and Distribution of Wealth (1766). Capital formation, interest as time-related phenomenon, early marginal reasoning.
- **Jean-Baptiste Say (1767–1832)**: Treatise on Political Economy (1803). Say’s Law (coordination of supply and demand via prices), role of the entrepreneur, production as transformation.
- **Frédéric Bastiat (1801–1850)**: Economic Sophisms (1845–48), The Law (1850), Economic Harmonies (1850). Opportunity cost, seen vs. unseen, spontaneous order of markets.
- **Hermann Heinrich Gossen (1810–1858)**: The Laws of Human Relations (1854). Marginal utility and diminishing marginal utility; foundational for subjective value.
- **Johann Heinrich von Thünen (1783–1850)**: Marginal productivity, spatial economics; anticipates imputational ideas later refined by Austrians.

### Why “Austrian”? Origins of the School (1870s–1900s)

- The label arose during the Methodenstreit (method dispute) with the German Historical School. Critics (notably Gustav Schmoller) tagged Carl Menger and his students as the “Austrian School” to emphasize their Vienna roots and methodological individualism.
- Distinguishing features: subjective value, marginalism, methodological individualism, causal-realist price theory, and attention to time, capital, and entrepreneurship.

### Core Thinkers in Chronological Order

#### Carl Menger (1840–1921)
- **Key works**: Principles of Economics (1871); Investigations into the Method of the Social Sciences (1883). 
- **Essence**: Founded Austrian economics. Articulated subjective value and marginal utility; price formation from individual choices; method: start from purposeful action of individuals (methodological individualism); emphasized the emergence of institutions (money) as spontaneous order.

#### Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk (1851–1914)
- **Key works**: Capital and Interest (3 vols., 1884/1889/1909); Karl Marx and the Close of His System (1896).
- **Essence**: Time preference and roundaboutness; structure of production; rigorous critique of the exploitation theory of interest; clarified how interest emerges from intertemporal exchange.

#### Friedrich von Wieser (1851–1926)
- **Key works**: Natural Value (1889); Social Economics (1914).
- **Essence**: Imputation theory (how factor prices derive from consumer valuations); popularized “opportunity cost”; charted marginal utility’s implications for distribution and costs.

#### Ludwig von Mises (1881–1973)
- **Key works**: The Theory of Money and Credit (1912); Socialism (1922); Human Action (1949); Epistemological Problems of Economics (1933).
- **Essence**: Praxeology (economics as the logic of purposeful action); monetary theory including the regression theorem; economic calculation problem in socialism; development of the Austrian Business Cycle Theory (ABCT) with credit-induced malinvestment.

#### Friedrich A. Hayek (1899–1992)
- **Key works**: Prices and Production (1931); The Road to Serfdom (1944); The Use of Knowledge in Society (1945); The Constitution of Liberty (1960); Law, Legislation and Liberty (1973–79).
- **Essence**: Knowledge problem and decentralized coordination via prices; spontaneous order; capital structure and cycles; political economy of limited government and the rule of law. Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences (1974).

#### Ludwig Lachmann (1906–1990)
- **Key works**: Capital and Its Structure (1956); The Market as an Economic Process (1986).
- **Essence**: Radical subjectivism of expectations; capital heterogeneity; open-ended market processes rather than equilibrium endpoints.

#### Murray N. Rothbard (1926–1995)
- **Key works**: Man, Economy, and State (1962) with Power and Market; America’s Great Depression (1963); The Mystery of Banking (1983).
- **Essence**: Systematic treatise extending Misesian praxeology; detailed critique of central banking and fractional-reserve banking; applied Austrian price theory and ABCT to U.S. economic history and policy.

#### Israel M. Kirzner (1930– )
- **Key works**: Competition and Entrepreneurship (1973); Perception, Opportunity, and Profit (1979).
- **Essence**: Entrepreneurship as discovery and alertness; markets as a process of error correction; competition as an open-ended discovery procedure rather than a static state.

#### Other important contributors (20th–21st c.)
- **Oskar Morgenstern (1902–1977)**: Methodology; co-founded game theory (with von Neumann); early ties to Vienna.
- **Fritz Machlup (1902–1983)**: Knowledge production, monopoly, and measurement.
- **George L. S. Shackle (1903–1992)**: Radical uncertainty and imagination in choice.
- **Don Lavoie (1951–2001)**: Computation vs. communication in socialist calculation; Austrian insights and computation.
- **Gerald P. O’Driscoll & Mario Rizzo**: The Economics of Time and Ignorance (1985); time, knowledge, and coordination.
- **Roger W. Garrison**: Time and Money (2001); graphical exposition of ABCT and capital-based macro.
- **Lawrence H. White & George Selgin**: Free banking, monetary institutions, and competitive note issue (closely allied with Austrian monetary themes).
- **Jesús Huerta de Soto**: Money, Bank Credit, and Economic Cycles (1998); Austrian monetary theory and banking.
- **Peter J. Boettke, Peter T. Leeson, Christopher J. Coyne**: Political economy of development, institutional analysis, self-governance and polycentric orders.

### Influence and Legacy (post-1940s to present)

- **Macroeconomic debates**: Austrian Business Cycle Theory sparred with Keynesianism; later influenced real-business-cycle and monetary disequilibrium discussions.
- **Public choice and constitutional political economy**: Hayek’s work influenced James Buchanan and the analysis of rules and institutions.
- **New Institutional Economics and self-governance**: Hayek’s knowledge problem resonates with Elinor Ostrom’s work on polycentric governance and rules-in-use.
- **Law & economics and antitrust**: Emphasis on knowledge limits and dynamic efficiency shaped skepticism toward micromanaging market structure.
- **Entrepreneurship and management**: Kirzner’s discovery framework influenced modern entrepreneurship research and strategy (market process, dynamic competition).
- **Complexity economics**: Austrian themes on emergence, dispersed knowledge, and out-of-equilibrium dynamics parallel agent-based and complexity approaches.
- **Monetary reform and digital money**: Austrian critiques of central banking informed interest in free banking, currency competition, and later enthusiasm for hard-money digital assets in some communities. Hayek’s call for currency competition resonates with modern private/crypto monetary experimentation.
