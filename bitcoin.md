## Bitcoin and Austrian Economics (AET)

### Why there’s a connection

- **Hard money ethos**: AET emphasizes sound money and the problems of discretionary inflation. Bitcoin’s fixed supply (21M), halving schedule, and decentralized issuance align with AET’s skepticism of elastic money and central banking.
- **Rules over discretion**: Hayek’s [knowledge problem](./terms.md#knowledge-problem-dispersed-knowledge) and Mises’s [calculation critique](./terms.md#economic-calculation-calculation-problemcritique) imply monetary rules are superior to policy discretion. Bitcoin embeds a transparent rule (difficulty adjustment + fixed issuance) rather than discretionary committees.
- **Cantillon effects**: AET highlights that new money is non-neutral; early recipients benefit at others’ expense. Bitcoiners see this as a critique of QE/credit facilities; Bitcoin offers an asset outside these injection channels. See [Cantillon Effect](./terms.md#cantillon-effect), [Circulation Analysis](./terms.md#circulation-analysis-money-and-relative-prices).
- **Time preference and saving**: With credible scarcity, holders may lower [time preference](./terms.md#time-preference-and-roundaboutness), save more, and lengthen planning horizons—an AET theme linking money, interest, and capital formation.
- **Market competition in currencies**: Hayek favored currency competition; free-banking Austrians analyze non-monopoly monetary systems. Bitcoin is a live experiment in competing monies. See [Free Banking](./terms.md#free-banking).
- **ABCT relevance**: AET’s Austrian Business Cycle Theory critiques credit-driven booms from suppressed interest rates. Bitcoin does not eliminate credit cycles, but a hard monetary base is viewed as disciplining credit and pricing risk. See `terms.md` → ABCT, Malinvestment.

### Key links to AET concepts

- **Subjective value**: Bitcoin’s value emerges from user expectations and network effects, not intrinsic inputs. See [Subjective Value](./terms.md#subjective-value), [Entrepreneurship](./terms.md#entrepreneurship-discovery-and-alertness).
- **Praxeology and institutional design**: Bitcoin is interpreted through action, incentives, and rules. Its constraints (fixed supply, permissionless entry, verifiable ledger) create predictable incentives. See [Praxeology](./praxeology.md#praxeology-the-logic-of-human-action).
- **Knowledge problem**: Price signals coordinate dispersed knowledge; Bitcoin’s rule avoids the pretense of knowledge in setting “optimal” money growth. See [Knowledge Problem](./terms.md#knowledge-problem-dispersed-knowledge).
- **Relative prices and calculation**: A predictable base money helps economic calculation; unpredictable base growth distorts relative prices. See [Relative Prices](./terms.md#relative-prices), [Economic Calculation](./terms.md#economic-calculation-calculation-problemcritique).

### Why many bitcoiners lean Austrian

- Critique of central banks, seigniorage, and discretionary policy aligns with AET.
- Preference for rule-based institutions, property rights, and spontaneous order resonates with Bitcoin’s design and governance norms.
- Focus on savings, capital formation, and low time preference fits the “store-of-value first” adoption path.
- Skepticism of aggregate targets (CPI, NGDP) and emphasis on relative-price signals make them wary of broad stimulus and bailouts.

### Debates within the Austrian camp about Bitcoin

- **Regression theorem**: Some argue Bitcoin satisfies it via its initial non-monetary value (ledger utility, collectible value, payment utility) and expectations; others contest the fit with Mises’s original commodity framing. See [Regression Theorem](./terms.md#regression-theorem).
- **Volatility and unit-of-account**: Critics note high volatility and limited pricing in sats; proponents argue monetization is gradual (collectible → store of value → medium of exchange → unit of account).
- **Energy/cost-of-production**: AET rejects cost-of-production as a value determinant; mining cost affects supply decisions, not value. Subjective value and scarcity drive price.
- **Free banking vs. fixed base**: Some free-bankers prefer competitive note issue on commodity reserves; others see Bitcoin as the reserve asset for a new free-banking layer.
- **Credit cycles**: Hard base money doesn’t eliminate credit; cycles can still occur via maturity mismatch. Debate centers on whether a Bitcoin standard attenuates malinvestment by constraining base expansion.

### Risks and misconceptions (AET lens)

- Treating price level stability as the goal can ignore relative-price coordination. AET stresses relative prices and capital structure over aggregates.
- Assuming policy discretion can fine-tune cycles conflicts with knowledge and calculation limits.
- Believing mining “backs” value confuses costs with valuations; causality runs from expected value to willingness to incur mining cost.

### Crisis backstory: 2008 and Satoshi’s signal

- Housing/mortgage bubble: years of low policy rates, lax underwriting, securitization/mispriced AAA risk, maturity mismatch in shadow banking, and implicit backstops encouraged leverage and housing malinvestment. See [ABCT](./terms.md#austrian-business-cycle-theory-abct).
- Bust and bailouts: when short-term funding froze, authorities backstopped banks and dealers (TARP, guarantees, QE). Relative prices and risk premia were repressed; losses socialized, gains privatized (moral hazard).
- Satoshi’s embedded headline in the genesis block highlighted this regime:

```
The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks
```

- Household outcomes: foreclosures and unemployment hit families, while asset purchases supported financial balance sheets. Asset prices recovered faster than wages/incomes, widening wealth dispersion. See [Cantillon Effect](./terms.md#cantillon-effect).

### 2020–2021 pandemic response and inflation

- Policy mix: massive QE plus large fiscal transfers and income supports; lockdown mandates and supply chain frictions constrained output. Bank reserves surged; deposits and spending rose via transfers.
- “Transitory” to persistent: initial official guidance emphasized temporary effects; inflation broadened as demand ran ahead of constrained supply, and relative prices shifted. Later narratives stressed supply chains, but monetary/fiscal impulse amplified demand. See [Relative Prices](./terms.md#relative-prices) and [Circulation Analysis](./terms.md#circulation-analysis-money-and-relative-prices).
- Distribution: injection paths mattered—recipients of early transfers and asset holders benefited first; renters and late wage earners lagged. See [Cantillon Effect](./terms.md#cantillon-effect).

### Policy trade-offs: QE, LOLR, bailouts (AET view)

- Lend freely at a penalty rate on good collateral (LOLR) can quell liquidity panics with less distortion than open-ended QE or equity bailouts.
- Broad QE suppresses yields and distorts relative prices; long programs risk malinvestment and “zombies.”
- Direct bailouts recapitalize quickly but maximize moral hazard.

### Why Bitcoin matters in these episodes

- Rule-bound money: fixed issuance avoids discretion in base-money growth, reducing policy-driven redistribution via [Cantillon effects](./terms.md#cantillon-effect).
- Calculation and credibility: predictable supply aids long-horizon planning; avoids attempts to “fine-tune” money that run into the [knowledge problem](./terms.md#knowledge-problem-dispersed-knowledge) and [calculation critique](./terms.md#economic-calculation-calculation-problemcritique).
- Exit option and competition: offers a competing monetary standard outside central-bank balance sheets, disciplining policy by providing a credible alternative.
- Not a panacea: credit cycles can still occur on top of a hard base; institutions and maturity structure still matter. See [ABCT](./terms.md#austrian-business-cycle-theory-abct).
