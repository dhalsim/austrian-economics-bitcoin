## Bitcoin and Austrian Economics (AET)

### Why there’s a connection

- **Hard money ethos**: AET emphasizes sound money and the problems of discretionary inflation. Bitcoin’s fixed supply (21M), halving schedule, and decentralized issuance align with AET’s skepticism of elastic money and central banking.
- **Rules over discretion**: Hayek’s knowledge problem and Mises’s calculation critique imply monetary rules are superior to policy discretion. Bitcoin embeds a transparent rule (difficulty adjustment + fixed issuance) rather than discretionary committees.
- **Cantillon effects**: AET highlights that new money is non-neutral; early recipients benefit at others’ expense. Bitcoiners see this as a critique of QE/credit facilities; Bitcoin offers an asset outside these injection channels. See [Cantillon Effect](./terms.md#cantillon-effect), [Circulation Analysis](./terms.md#circulation-analysis-money-and-relative-prices).
- **Time preference and saving**: With credible scarcity, holders may lower time preference, save more, and lengthen planning horizons—an AET theme linking money, interest, and capital formation.
- **Market competition in currencies**: Hayek favored currency competition; free-banking Austrians analyze non-monopoly monetary systems. Bitcoin is a live experiment in competing monies. See [Free Banking](./terms.md#free-banking).
- **ABCT relevance**: AET’s Austrian Business Cycle Theory critiques credit-driven booms from suppressed interest rates. Bitcoin does not eliminate credit cycles, but a hard monetary base is viewed as disciplining credit and pricing risk. See `terms.md` → ABCT, Malinvestment.

### Key links to AET concepts

- **Subjective value**: Bitcoin’s value emerges from user expectations and network effects, not intrinsic inputs. See [Subjective Value](./terms.md#subjective-value), [Entrepreneurship](./terms.md#entrepreneurship-discovery-and-alertness).
- **Praxeology and institutional design**: Bitcoin is interpreted through action, incentives, and rules. Its constraints (fixed supply, permissionless entry, verifiable ledger) create predictable incentives. See [Praxeology](./praxeology.md#praxeology-the-logic-of-human-action).
- **Knowledge problem**: Price signals coordinate dispersed knowledge; Bitcoin’s rule avoids the pretense of knowledge in setting “optimal” money growth. See [Knowledge Problem](./terms.md#knowledge-problem-dispersed-knowledge).
- **Relative prices and calculation**: A predictable base money helps economic calculation; unpredictable base growth distorts relative prices. See [Relative Prices](./terms.md#relative-prices), [Economic Calculation](./terms.md#economic-calculation-calculation-problemcritique).

### Why many bitcoiners lean Austrian

- Critique of central banks, seigniorage, and discretionary policy aligns with AET.
- Preference for rule-based institutions, property rights, and spontaneous order resonates with Bitcoin’s design and governance norms.
- Focus on savings, capital formation, and low time preference fits the “store-of-value first” adoption path.
- Skepticism of aggregate targets (CPI, NGDP) and emphasis on relative-price signals make them wary of broad stimulus and bailouts.

### Debates within the Austrian camp about Bitcoin

- **Regression theorem**: Some argue Bitcoin satisfies it via its initial non-monetary value (ledger utility, collectible value, payment utility) and expectations; others contest the fit with Mises’s original commodity framing. See [Regression Theorem](./terms.md#regression-theorem).
- **Volatility and unit-of-account**: Critics note high volatility and limited pricing in sats; proponents argue monetization is gradual (collectible → store of value → medium of exchange → unit of account).
- **Energy/cost-of-production**: AET rejects cost-of-production as a value determinant; mining cost affects supply decisions, not value. Subjective value and scarcity drive price.
- **Free banking vs. fixed base**: Some free-bankers prefer competitive note issue on commodity reserves; others see Bitcoin as the reserve asset for a new free-banking layer.
- **Credit cycles**: Hard base money doesn’t eliminate credit; cycles can still occur via maturity mismatch. Debate centers on whether a Bitcoin standard attenuates malinvestment by constraining base expansion.

### Risks and misconceptions (AET lens)

- Treating price level stability as the goal can ignore relative-price coordination. AET stresses relative prices and capital structure over aggregates.
- Assuming policy discretion can fine-tune cycles conflicts with knowledge and calculation limits.
- Believing mining “backs” value confuses costs with valuations; causality runs from expected value to willingness to incur mining cost.
